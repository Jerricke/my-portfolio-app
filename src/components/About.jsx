                <h1>My Passion ðŸ”¥</h1>
                <p>Growing up with tech always right beside me, I&apos;ve spent countless amounts of time playing around with different web and mobile applicaitons. 
                <br/>As I finished by bachelor of science degree at UC San Diego, I grew more and more interested in building applications that would improve our daily lives.
                <br/>With the desire to build, I&apos;ve picked up programming on my free time, and ultimately decided to attend Flatiron School Software Engineering Bootcamp.
                <br/>Everyday I work with like-minded peers and hone my skills and craft with the goal of creating the most intuitive and well-rounded applications.
